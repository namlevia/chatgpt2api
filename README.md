## 🎛️ Deep Dive into ChatGPT2API Dashboard

> **👉 SEE DETAILS:** For ChatGPT Login methods (Access Token/Refresh Token) and in-depth Tab configurations, check out: **[📖 ChatGPT2API User Guide](README_ChatGPT2API.md)**

After installation, access the admin page at `http://[SERVER_IP]:3000` and log in with your password (Auth Key). The left-hand interface consists of main tabs. Here's how to master each one:

### 1. Overview Tab
- **Purpose**: Central dashboard monitoring system health in real-time.
- **Features**:
  - View active Requests, Success Rate.
  - Statistical chart of Tokens saved thanks to the Optimizer algorithm.
  - Quick tracking of "Active" or "Error" accounts.

### 2. Account Pool Tab
- **Purpose**: Manage free and paid (Plus/Pro) ChatGPT Web accounts.
- **How to safely get an Access Token**:
  1. Open an Incognito browser window, log in to [chatgpt.com](https://chatgpt.com).
  2. Paste `https://chatgpt.com/api/auth/session` into the address bar.
  3. Copy the very long string after `"accessToken":`. (Note: Close the window, DO NOT LOG OUT).
- **How to use this Tab**:
  - Click **Import Access Token**.
  - Paste your tokens (one token per line). Click Confirm.
  - The system automatically classifies it as Free or Plus. You can toggle each account. If it turns red, the Token has expired; delete and re-import.

### 3. Providers Tab
- **Purpose**: Use when you don't want to rely entirely on ChatGPT and want to use Gemini, DeepSeek, Groq.
- **How to use**:
  - Select the provider (e.g., **Gemini AI Studio**).
  - Paste the API Key obtained from Google into the blank field.
  - Click **Save**. The system is now ready to use third-party Models with the corresponding prefix (like `gemini_free/auto`).

### 4. Combos Tab (Smart Routing & Fallback - Most Important)
- **Purpose**: Create a smart processing flow so the AI never "freezes" if one source fails.
- **How to configure "Immortality"**:
  1. Click **Create Combo**. Give it a memorable name: `AI Agent`.
  2. In the Fallback Chain section, add in order from best to backup:
     - Line 1: `cx/auto` (Codex OAuth - best if you have it).
     - Line 2: `chatgpt/auto` (Regular ChatGPT account).
     - Line 3: `gemini_free/auto` (Google Gemini API backup 1).
     - Line 4: `oc/auto` (OpenCode - Final backup requiring no token).
  3. **Mechanism**: When you call the `AI Agent` model, the system tries `cx/auto`. If it hits a 429 error or network drop, it instantly (under 1 second) switches to `chatgpt/auto`, ensuring a response is always returned to the Smart Speaker.

### 5. Models Tab
- **Purpose**: Show/Hide available models so applications like n8n, OpenWebUI can scan them.
- **How to use**: You can enable (green check) or disable any model you don't want to appear in the `/v1/models` API. If using Codex, ensure you select the exact Prefix name (like `cx/gpt-4o`).

### 6. MCP Servers Tab (AI Expansion Tools)
- **Purpose**: Attach "Hands and feet", "Eyes and nose" to the AI (allowing the AI to Google Search, check weather, read news).
- **How to connect with VN MCP Hub**:
  1. **MCP Hub URL**: Enter `http://[SERVER_IP]:8005` (or `http://vn-mcp-hub:8005` if running in the same compose).
  2. The system will automatically scan "Presets" like: Weather, Stocks, Law.
  3. Click **Install/Enable** the tools you like. When activated, the AI Agent automatically has the ability to call tools whenever a user asks.

### 7. Backup / System Tab
- **Purpose**: Backup configurations and accounts in case of server migration.
- **How to use**: 
  - **Export**: Exports a JSON file of all API Keys, Access Tokens.
  - **Import 9router Backup**: Supports importing backup files from the old specialized 9router system directly.

## 🧠 Deep Dive into VN MCP Hub Studio (RAG Database)

> **👉 SEE DETAILS:** For instructions on teaching the AI (RAG) and configuring search engines, check out: **[📖 VN MCP Hub Configuration Guide](README_VN_MCP_HUB.md)**

Access `http://[SERVER_IP]:8005/studio` to open the AI's memory and tool control interface.

### 1. Knowledge Base Tab (Local Memory - RAG)
- **Concept**: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is the knowledge repository you teach the AI.
- **How to use**:
  - Pre-built repositories are available: Electricity/Water, Medical First Aid, Law.
  - You can click **Create New KB**, paste content (copy & paste) from company documents or family guides (as text or Markdown) into the content box. The Hub will automatically chunk and insert it into Chroma DB. The AI will later prioritize searching this repository before Googling.

### 2. Multi-Search Tab
- **Purpose**: Select international Search Engines for the AI to scan real-time data.
- **How to use**: Enable/disable sources: DuckDuckGo (Best default), Brave Search (Requires API Key), Wikipedia. If local RAG has no answer, the Hub will silently call Search.

### 3. Cloud Storage Tab
- **Purpose**: If the server hard drive fails, you lose the effort of teaching the AI. This tab uses Cloudflare R2 (or AWS S3) for backup.
- **Configuration**: Enter Endpoint URL, Access Key, Secret Key of the R2 bucket. Enable Auto Sync at 2 AM.

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

| Condition | Cause & Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Container keeps crashing (Crash loop)** | View logs with: `docker logs chatgpt2api`. Usually due to incorrect environment variable syntax. |
| **Assistant answers with `#`, `*` making it hard to hear** | Recheck the System Prompt in Home Assistant. Make sure you added the instruction not to use formatting. |
| **Error 400 "Model not supported"** | You are using a non-existent model. Go to Combos/Models Tab to check if the model has the correct Prefix format (e.g., `chatgpt/auto`). |
| **ChatGPT account keeps Expiring** | Because you clicked Log Out in the browser when getting the Token. Solution: Get a new Token from an Incognito tab and close the window, DO NOT Log Out. |
| **MCP Tools not responding or empty** | Check the MCP Server URL in the MCP Servers Tab. Test with the command: `curl http://[IP]:8005/health`. |
| **Out of disk** | Due to old docker logs or cache (especially Chroma DB). Run command: `docker system prune -af` |
